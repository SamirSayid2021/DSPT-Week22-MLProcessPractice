    "\n",
    "#### 1. Perform a Train-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the data into a dataframe using pandas, separate the features (`X`) from the target (`y`), and use the `train_test_split` function to separate data into training and test sets. Do a bit of exploration to become familiar with the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Build and Evaluate a First Simple Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `LinearRegression` model and `mean_squared_error` function from scikit-learn to arrive at your root mean squared error (RMSE), build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using just the training data. Also, use `cross_val_score` to simulate unseen data, without actually using the holdout test set just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Compare to a Different Model Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a `DecisionTreeRegressor` model, evaluating based on RMSE and using `cross_val_score` to avoid overfitting to the test set, to compare model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Choose Which Model to Use, then Iterate and Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on steps 2 and 3, and what you know from your initial exploration, decide whether you'd like to pursue a linear or tree-based model. Write out the justification of your decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you choose to continue with the linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use `PolynomialFeatures` to Reduce Underfitting: Apply a `PolynomialFeatures` transformer to give the model more ability to pick up on information from the training data. Test out different polynomial degrees until you have a model that is perfectly fit to the training data.\n",
    "    - Use Regularization to Reduce Overfitting: Instead of a basic `LinearRegression`, use a `Ridge` regression model to apply regularization to the overfit model. In order to do this you will need to scale the data. Test out different regularization penalties to find the best model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- If you choose to continue with the tree-based model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Level Up to an Ensemble Method: Implement an example of both a bagged (`RandomForestRegressor` or `ExtraTreesRegressor`) and boosted (`AdaBoostRegressor` or `XGBRegressor`) model, and decide which one to tune. Remember that you're exploring without yet finding the optimal parameters at this point, so write out your justification for choosing one over another.\n",
    "    - Find Optimal Hyperparameters: Use visualizations and `GridSearchCV` to tune the model you choose to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Evaluate a Final Model on the Test Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Process `X_test` and `y_test` appropriately in order to evaluate the performance of your final model on unseen data."

    "1. Most importantly, we are avoiding *leakage* of information from the test set into the training set.
